! === This is the default input file ===
! first nonempty uncommented('!' or '#') line is taken as arguments
! program accept comand line parameters in following format where SPACE=' '
! all entities are mandatory
! === FORMAT ===
! :"component(s)":SPACE"molar ratio(s)"SPACE"temperature"SPACE"density"SPACE"k_ij"SPACE"computed properties flag(s)"
! === SPECIFICATION ===
! - "component(s)" denotes computed components
!   * in form :first component,second component2,...: i.e. :methane,carbon dioxide:
! - "molar ratio(s)" is always required! it is i.e. 1.0 or 0.57,0.43 ...
! - "temperature" is single positive number representing temperature in kelvins i.e. 200
!	* parser is capable of handling both integer 200 and float 200.0 input
! - "density" is single positive number representing computation density in mol/m^3 i.e. 997
!	* parser is capable of handling both integer 997 and float 997.0 input
! - "k_ij" is binary interaction coeffitient - it is single number i.e. 0
!	* parser is capable of handling both integer 0 and float 0.0 input
! - "computed properties flag(s)" request for the computed outputs - only the requested will be printed/outputed
!		even when other useful parameters are also computed i.e. p,mu,fug
!	*	p	 - pressure computation
!	*	pp	 - first density derivative of pressure
!	*	ppp	 - second density derivative of pressure
!	*	mu	 - chemical potentials in same order as names
!	*	fug	 - fugacity coeffitient in same order as names
!	*	a	 - Helmholtz energy A
!	*	h	 - Entalpy H - residual part
!	*	s	 - Entropy S - residual part
!	*	g	 - Gibbs energy G - residual part
!	*	1/2/3- control over numerical difference (if enabled in code)
